Cryptoline gathers the data provided by Binance API as well as CoinMarketCap API, cleans these data using Pandas and uses it to produce new data, then uses the cleaned and processed data to build a dashboard containing important information about that cryptocurrency as well as 4 charts (a candlestick chart representing the price change over time, a Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, bar chart representing the volume and a pie chart describing the share of that cryptocurrency compared to the whole cryptocurrencies market).
The information about the chosen cryptocurrency (the trading pair, the time frame and the depth) and the RSI length value are going to be passed by the user through the interactive dashboard.
